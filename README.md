# massive_gaussian_naive_bayes

This matlab code implements the popular Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier based on sparse matrices operations with the purpose of accelerating searchlight classification algorithms. 

It can be used for implementing a large collection of GNB classifiers and for acellerating permutation test for classification.
 
An ensemble of GNB classifiers is computed without a for loop using sparse matrix operations. Sample data and a test script are provided.
